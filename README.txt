This project allows for z tests to be performed quickly and easily. 
Users simply needs to input the which type of test is being performed followed by the requested information. The program will do the calculations and show the standard deviation used, the z score, and the probability of this occuring. If the sample distribution is not normal, then it will tell the user, but still perform the calculations.

The equation converting a z score to the correct probabilty utilizes erf from the Apache Commons Mathematics Library (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/).
